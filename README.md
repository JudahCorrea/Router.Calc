# Router.Calc
A system for calculating a route based on the distance between two points.

# How to Use
First, you provide your address: street name, number, neighborhood.

then search for the address you want to go to, using the same syntax as: street name, number, neighborhood.
So just submit how much is the liter of fuel and how much your vehicle performs with one liter of fuel.

Then the system will calculate the distance to the points and compute them together with the fuel data.
